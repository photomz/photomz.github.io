- The Myth of Sisyphus -- Albert Camus (31 May 2024)
	- *Summary* -- Life is absurd! We want reasons and meaning, but we get an endlessly chaotic universe -- this paradox is the Absurd. If life has no universal meaning, should you kill yourself? No, Camus argues, we must revolt against death and construct our own meaning. We must enjoy the precious little time left to do whatever we please -- or, *carpe diem*. Without universal nature, human rules are not moral punishments to blame but consequences to accept. Sisyphus is not miserable. His pointless struggle to push a rock up a hill is really his happy defiance against God -- his very own choice of meaning.
	- *Review* -- Camus had 1000 years of Christian political dogma to reject; today, existentialism seems obvious. His insistence on the 'absurd' makes him disavow universal meaning, but he also downplays human-constructed meaning, -- like markets, technology, societies, family, etc -- which is incorrect ...

- Foundation 2 -- Issac Asimov (7 Jan 2024)
	- *Review* -- A gripping sci-fi tale of man's return from nuclear tech to farming across the Galaxy, and the Foundation against it. Stokes imagination of an intergalactic future, giving satisfying just-so deductions of politics and war that historians despise and engineers adore.
	- *Reflection* -- I'm starting to love sci-fi for their stoic 'View from Above' -- on a cosmic scale, your actions matter little; but that's no reason to despair! The Universe is majestic and divine, and you're so lucky to be a speck of that oneness, so maybe forgive that friend who insulted your beliefs. Maybe your cold feet on a foggy San Francisco morning, at a cosmic scale, is simply ok -- no reason to curse weather.
- Freakonomics -- Steven Levitt (24 Dec)
- Foundation 1 -- Issac Asimov (10 Dec)
- The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy 1 -- Douglas Adams (4 Dec)
- Elon Musk -- Walter Issacson (3 Dec)
	- *Notes on Elon*: His biographies reek of lurid superfluous detail, as rich person drama sells. Like historians, they piece together a puzzle and hear all views, but lacking a thorough logic of why and how his businesses work, they resort to syllogisms, sensational anecdotes and he-said-she-said. In that respect, his TED interview is logically clearer and veers off less tangents. Of a man who tirelessly aims to transcend and suffer for a wider humanity, books obsessing over Elon’s cult of personality miss the point quite pitifully.
	- Elon’s own words show it better than his biographers’—he’s as technical as they come, dodges reporters prying for manic-depressive tabloid gossip, and obsesses over unbeatable process and execution to get it done. Vance and Isaacson wanted a mythical strongman when really primary sources—his process, patents, line of thinking, emails—reveal far more to readers who endeavor to name Musk on their List of Influences upon becoming famous.
	- Anything attempting a serious study of Musk should avert their eyes.
