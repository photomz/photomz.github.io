Yo, I'm Markus! On gap year from Stanford CS, I'm self-learning AI ([& math](https://x.com/photon_mz/status/1717154442024509589?s=20)) and designing great AI-first products.

I also reflect on my life in [Substack](https://photonmz.substack.com/).

### 🏠 Where I've been

I've been an AI engineer at [Nox AI](https://www.heynox.com),  [Galileo AI](https://twitter.com/arnaudai/status/1623359864100601861) and [EntryLevel](https://entrylevel.net/). In high school, I also built [Edu-pal](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edu-pal-learning-feedback/geopbiaefoieahodpfbclhoabkikbnkn), a Google Meet extension for live Q&A in remote classes -- which grew to 500k logins before COVID-19 ended.
