Yo, I'm Markus! On gap year from Stanford CS, I'm self-learning AI ([& math](https://x.com/photon_mz/status/1717154442024509589?s=20)) to research LLM interpretability.

I also write thinly-veiled allegories about my life in [Substack](https://photonmz.substack.com/).

### 🏠 Where I've been

I've been an AI engineer at [Galileo AI](https://twitter.com/arnaudai/status/1623359864100601861) and [EntryLevel](https://entrylevel.net/). In high school, I also built [Edu-pal](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edu-pal-learning-feedback/geopbiaefoieahodpfbclhoabkikbnkn), a Google Meet extension for live Q&A in remote classes -- which grew to 500k logins before COVID-19 ended.

[What I'm reading](./reading)
### ⚙️ What I've built

- [Softermax](./softermax): Can changing Softmax fix "no-op" attention heads?
- [BabyDoctor](https://github.com/photomz/BabyDoctor): Llama 2 x Ultrasound x LoRA finetuning = an AI radiologist (totally not medical advice). Built @ [4Catalyzer Hackathon](https://x.com/photon_mz/status/1687352039007977472?s=20), won 2nd prize
- [Playflow](https://playfloow.netlify.app/): Built a web crawler for 10M Spotify playlists -- to pretrain embeddings for song recs (like a search graph).
- [Securus](https://github.com/photomz/securus): Pokemon Go for COVID-19 -- an AI traffic camera makes sure you wear a mask. Won @ AWS Southeast Asia Hackathon.
